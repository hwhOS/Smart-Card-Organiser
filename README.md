# Smart-Card-Organiser
An iOS-controlled card organiser uses an ESP32 microcontroller for precise card slot alignment, a servo for card dispensing, and an intuitive app for selecting and ejecting cards. The repository has iOS app source code, ESP32 Arduino sketches, and 3D design files for the hardware.
